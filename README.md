# zoeclearningcode
a place where I stored any resources related to learning code

It's the firsrt time and frist day I use github as a public platform to learn how to code by making tons of mistake

Why coding? Back then, I was always see myself as a girl who was not good and qualified to learn the tech things. Deep down I had a thought that I'm not my sister, I can be able to think logically like her!!

But then I realized that, I don't need to be her or anyone else, I just need to be ME. But fisrt, I have to find me through the process of trails and errors.

As a upcoming digital marketing program student, I want to specialized in programming and choose fronend developer as my future career.

I'm ready to fail, and then try over and over again as much as possible utill it suceed.
